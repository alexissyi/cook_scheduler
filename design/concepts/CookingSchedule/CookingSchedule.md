**concept** CookScheduler

**purpose** create cooking assignments for the month so we know who cooks when

**principle** user availabilities and preferences are uploaded by all users independently; cooking dates are added based on WILG meal plan calendar; can then use LLM to generate cooking assignments that satisfy the constraints; can also edit the resulting assignments;

**state** 

a Month

a Year

a set of Dates CookingDates

a set of User Cooks with 

&ensp; a Kerb

a set of Availability Availabilities with

&ensp; a User

&ensp; a set of Dates

a set of Preference Preferences with

&ensp; a User
    
&ensp; a boolean CanSolo
    
&ensp; a boolean CanLead
    
&ensp; a boolean CanAssist
    
&ensp; a number MaxCookingDays
    
a set of Assignment Assignments with
    
&ensp; a Date
    
&ensp; a Lead
    
&ensp; an optional Assistant

**invariants**

all dates in CookingDates are in Month in Year

every Assignment in Assignments has a Date in CookingDates and a Lead in Cooks; if it has an Assistant, the Assistant is in Cooks

**requires** no User is in Cooks with the same kerb as user

**effect** adds user to Cooks

removeCook(user: User):

**requires** user is in Cooks
        
**effect** removes user and any associated Preference, Availability or Assignments

setMonth(month: number):

**requires** month is an integer in [1, 12] and no assignments exist that have a date outside of this month

**effect** sets Month to month

setYear(year: number):

**requires** year is a nonnegative integer and no assignments exist that have a date outside of this year

**effect** sets Year to year

addCookingDate(date: Date):

**requires** date is not in CookingDates and date is in Month

**effect** adds date to CookingDates

removeCookingDate(date: Date):

**requires** date is in CookingDates

**effect** removes date from CookingDates

assignLead(user: User, date: Date):

**requires** date is in CookingDates; user is in the set of Users, user has CanLead or CanSolo marked as True in their associated Preference

**effect** creates a new Assignment with date and Lead set to user if there is no existing Assignment for this date, or updates an existing Assignment if there already is an Assignment for this date

assignAssistant(user: User, date: Date)

**requires** date is in CookingDates; user is in Cooks; there is already an Assignment with this date in the set of Assignments, the lead for that assignment has CanLead marked as True in their associated Preference

**effect** sets Assistant in the existing Assignment for this date to be user

removeAssignment(date: Date)

**requires** there is an Assignment with this date in the set of Assignments

**effect** removes this Assignment from the set of Assignments

**effect** adds availability to Availabilities or updates Availabilities if there is already a availability for the user, removes all incompatible Assignments

async generateAssignments()

**requires** the set of Users for both Availabilities and Preferences are subsets of Cooks and no existing Assignments violate those Availabilities and Preferences

**effect** generates an assignment of Users to the CookingDates via an algorithm that violates no constraints in Availabilities or Preferences and satisfies all prior existing Assignments

async generateAssignmentsWithLLM()

**requires** the set of Users for both Availabilities and Preferences are subsets of Cooks and no existing Assignments violate those Availabilities and Preferences

**effect** generates an assignment of Users to the CookingDates with an LLM that violates no constraints in Availabilities or Preferences and satisfies all prior existing Assignments
