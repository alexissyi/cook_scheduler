## Reflections

I found concept design quite interesting and I've come to appreciate it as a foundational design strategy over time. 

I avoided using LLMs for the most part, except for debugging, adding CSS styling, and getting the initial script for generating the calendar displays on my site. I wanted to learn as much of the syntax on my own as possible. I think this did hinder my pace on assignments, but overall I'm satisfied with this approach, since I don't think I would've learned as much if I didn't do it by hand. For example, I'm really comfortable with Vue.js and pinia stores now, but I still suck at CSS, and I think that just correlates with how much I used an LLM for each aspect. 

LLMs seem very useful when you know exactly what you want to do and understand best practices around how to do it. This is something I learned over my summer internship, where my manager was having everyone on the team use LLMs. However, for learning, I find it to be more of a hindrance than a help if I use it for anything except debugging. I will continue to avoid using LLMs in the future if the goal is learning; I can see it becoming more useful once I'm more experienced and am focusing more on actually developing.
